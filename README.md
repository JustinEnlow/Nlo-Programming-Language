# The Nlo programming language
This is designed to be my ideal systems programming language. This language is not designed with anyone else in mind. I do not expect it to compete with any of the already established languages.

The language is currently in the design phase, and is likely to change with my preferences and as my knowledge grows. I am a fairly new programmer, and am likely to miss obvious issues early on, or to just have generally incorrect ideas.



# Language goals
* Systems level programming
    * the language should be usable anywhere from operating systems and drivers to games and desktop applications
    * the language is designed around separation of data and logic, and favors immutability as a default
    * impeccable runtime performance is desired
* Ease of use
    * package manager with integrated compiler. easy creation and compilation of projects through a command line utility
    * ahead of time compilation
    * module system. modules specified for each file, no separated header and source files
    * automatic memory management based on scope
    * built in testing. test suite as inherent feature of the language/package manager
* Full and clear expression
    * names of modules, variables, and functions should express their design/intent as clearly as possible. for example, instead of stdlib, StandardLibrary is more desirable
    * built in types may be abbreviated, but their meaning should be clear at first use to anyone familiar with programming, and easily learnable by programming newcomers
    * these conventions are not enforcable, but /*idomatic*/ a desired characteristic of the language
* Safety
    * eliminate null pointers, dangling pointers, data races
    * safe parallel processing
* Data ownership system
* Exhaustive control flow and enum matching
    * no undefined behavior
* informative error/warning messages
* code editor integration
    * currently only syntax highlighting works, and only in visual studio code. This needs much more work before it is ready
    * syntax and semantic highlighting
    * context aware auto-completion
    * code snippets
    * error/warning underlining

# Package Manager/Compiler
* creates and compiles projects
* handles dependencies
* controlled through command line, using various control keywords
---
create a new executable program in current directory
```
nlo new prog ProjectName
```
---
create a new library in current directory
```
nlo new lib ProjectName
```
---
check for errors/warnings without building executable
```
nlo check
```
---
build executable and check for errors/warnings
```
nlo build
```
---
run tests. output pass/fail to command line for each test
```
nlo test
```
---
build and run the program
```
nlo run
```
