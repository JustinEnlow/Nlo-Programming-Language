Goals:
    Full and Clear expression
        - no abbreviation except for built in types and keywords
        - StandardLibrary instead of stdlib
            this is not enforcable, but /*idiomatic*/ a desired characteristic of the language
    
    Ahead of time compilation
        - compile time error checking
    
    Data ownership
    
    Automatic memory management
        - based on scope
    
    Safety
        - eliminate null pointers, dangling pointers, data races
        - safe parallel processing
    
    Built in Testing
        - test suite as inherent feature of the language
    
    No header files
        - no separation of variable/function definition/implementation to different files
    
    Exhaustive Control flow and Enum matching
        - no undefined behavior
        - any if must have an else
