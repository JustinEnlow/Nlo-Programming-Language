// Console commands for My Programming Language. Tentatively "Nlo".

//Creation
nlo new YourProjectName - creates new folder with specified project name. project is not executable itself, 
it is used by other programs
                                folder contains:
                                    src subfolder:
                                    test subfolder:
                                        Test.nlo
                                    Nlo.toml

nlo new exe YourProgramName - creates new folder with specified project name. project is executable.
                                folder contains:
                                    src subfolder:
                                        Main.nlo
                                    test subfolder:
                                        Test.nlo
                                    Nlo.toml

//Use
nlo build - compiles project in current directory, ignoring tests. outputs build success, warnings, 
            and errors to command line interface.
nlo test - compiles project in current directory, and runs tests. outputs build success, warnings, 
            errors, and test results to command line interface.
nlo run - compiles project in current directory, ignoring tests. outputs build succes, warnings, and 
            errors to command line interface. executes program if build successful.


any .nlo file in src folder, except for Main.nlo, must implement a top level module with the project name.
when a new .nlo file is created, some code should be automatically generated

    example: 
        nlo new lib ProjectName

        add file at ProjectName/src called "FileName.nlo"

            public module ProjectName{
                public module FileName{}
            }

        or, for brevity:

            public module ProjectName:FileName{

            }
