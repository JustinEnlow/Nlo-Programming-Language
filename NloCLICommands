// Console commands for My Programming Language. Tentatively "Nlo".

//Creation
nlo new lib YourLibraryName - creates new folder with specified project name
                                folder contains:
                                    src subfolder:
                                    test subfolder:
                                        test.nlo
                                    Nlo.toml

nlo new prog YourProgramName - creates new folder with specified project name
                                folder contains:
                                    src subfolder:
                                        main.nlo
                                    test subfolder:
                                        test.nlo
                                    Nlo.toml

//Use
nlo build - compiles project in current directory, ignoring tests. outputs build success, warnings, 
            and errors to command line interface.
nlo test - compiles project in current directory, and runs tests. outputs build success, warnings, 
            errors, and test results to command line interface.
nlo run - compiles project in current directory, ignoring tests. outputs build succes, warnings, and 
            errors to command line interface. executes program if build successful.


any .nlo file in src folder must implement a top level module with the project name.

    example: 
        nlo new lib SomeProject

        add file at SomeProject/src called "SomeFile.nlo"

        SomeFile.nlo must implement:

            public module SomeProject{
                public module SomeFile{
                    /*
                    your code here
                    */
                }
            }

        or, for brevity

            public module SomeProject:SomeFile{
                /*
                your code here
                */
            }
